# Romberg-Rule-Python
Romberg Integration is an extrapolation formula of  the Trapezoidal Rule for integration. It provides a  better approximation of the integral by reducing the  True Error. This program implements Romberg rule of integration in python programming language. I hope you find it useful. Email me if you have any questions about this code.
